👋 Hey there, fellow coder!
Welcome to my GitHub lair—where spaghetti code meets last-minute fixes, and commit messages range from "Fixed stuff" to "I have no idea what I'm doing."

🚀 About Me:
🔥 I break things so you don’t have to (you're welcome).
💻 I write code... sometimes it even works!
🤖 I talk to my computer more than to real people.
🛠️ I believe in "Ctrl + C, Ctrl + V" as a lifestyle.
🏆 My GitHub Achievements:
✅ Pushed code at 3 AM (big mistake).
✅ Used git commit --amend to hide my crimes.
✅ Wrote a function, forgot why.
✅ Stack Overflow enthusiast (a.k.a. professional Googler).

📢 Fun Fact:
My code runs perfectly... on the second try.
