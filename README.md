I'm Alexander Grill, a highly caffeinated, semi-functional developer who spends more time debugging than actually coding. 🐛🔍

🚀 My code works... on my machine.
🎩 I write spaghetti code, but it's al dente.
🐍 Python lover, but still scared of actual snakes.
📊 GitHub Stats (Realistic Edition):
✅ 10% Writing code
🐞 50% Fixing bugs I created

🦸‍♂️ Summon me with Stack Overflow tags.
🚀 Or just send a carrier pigeon.
🚀 Let's write some code... and then spend hours wondering why it doesn’t work!
